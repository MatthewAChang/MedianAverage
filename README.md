# MedianAverage

Median Average is a program I created for CPSC 213: Introduction to Computer Systems at UBC. This program will take a list of students and return the ID of the student with the median average grade. This program initially contains a list of students who each have an ID and a list of grades.

The program is broken into three main functions and goes to them with jumps and returns by storing the program counter. The first part is a while loop that calculates the averages of each student. The second part uses bubble sort to sort the students by their average and the third part grabs the median student and returns their ID.
